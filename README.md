# Retail Analytics
This sprint project, as part of the York University Big Data and Advanced Analytics course, focuses on enhancing customer experience by providing customers relevant recommendations on grocery store items that are most commonly bought based on either their purchase history, items in cart, or other associations, through a machine learning model that uses Association Rule Mining (an a priori algorithm)

# The Context
The goal of our analysis and report is to build personalized grocery baskets and an intelligent product recommendation system to improve the customer online experience which will help the "company" keep their existing customers but also win over those who are still hesitating to join the loyalty program.

Our company is obsessed with providing our customers the best experience possible and has asked us, the Data Analytics team, to improve the shopping experience of the customer by providing them with pre-determined grocery baskets for weekly groceries. Our target audience is the customer. With the dataset supplied, we can recommend them product(s) that the customer will most likely buy and add it to the basket. Baskets will be customizable, allowing the customer to add/ edit/ delete the items. Initially, the baskets will be created with available purchase history. Overtime, the model will adapt and predict the customers' weekly groceries (based on recent purchases) or add-on recommendations (if missing a common item, or an item commonly bought after a certain one, or a popular item on sale, etc.) one by one, depending on customer patterns (both at an individual level and store-wide level).

# The Breakdown
The project is broken down into two main parts - the business understanding/data exploration and preparation (Part 1), and the model development, testing, and deployment (Part 2).
